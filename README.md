# Can School Choice Make the World (Cup) a Better Place?


## Abstract
The FIFA World Cup is the worldâ€™s biggest sporting event when it comes around
every 4 years. As such, the demand to acquire a ticket to watch a game in person is
unfathomably high. Currently, FIFA uses an entirely random lottery to distribute
tickets to fans. The demand is high enough that all tickets will be sold out, but it
does not mean that most fans will end up with the tickets they want the most, and
many will simply get tickets which are "good enough". In this paper, we seek to
find what important properties of market design are fulfilled by the current ticket
allocation method. Furthermore, we find that DAA with Multiple Tie Breaking,
also known as the School choice mode, is a better and more robust mechanism for
those getting tickets, that will satisfy more people by giving them a more preferred
ticket. This proposed mechanism gives a high percentage of fans their first choice
ticket, as well as being stable and strategyproof.
